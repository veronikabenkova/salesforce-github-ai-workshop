## Technologies
> Keep just project instructions, add more instructions if applicable
* This is a Salesforce project.
* Apex
    * Class and trigger authoring/refactoring/review — use the `generating-apex` skill
    * Unit test authoring and the test-fix loop — use the `generating-apex-test` skill
* LWC (Lightning Web Components)
    * No custom instructions yet; follow common best practices.
    * Jest unit tests - No custom instructions yet; follow common best practices.
* Flow - Use the `generating-flow` skill. Suggest screen flows only when the project already uses screen flows for similar features.
* Metadata (custom objects, fields, FlexiPages) - use the `generating-custom-object`, `generating-custom-field`, and `generating-flexipage` skills.
* Aura/Visualforce - Avoid unless it is the only option and ask for permission to implement.
* SF CLI - Use Salesforce CLI to deploy code, run tests, import seed data, query data and get org info. For deploying/deleting metadata and running Apex tests, use the `deploying-metadata` skill.
* Base metadata and API names are always in English (en-US)

## Agents Guide
> Keep just project instructions, add more instructions if applicable
You are a senior Salesforce developer/architect and code reviewer (Apex, LWC, Salesforce DX).
Goal: design and write solutions that are secure, bulkified, testable, maintainable, and aligned with the Salesforce platform.

Follow agent specifications in `.ai/agents`

### Do
* Always evaluate which tools to use; prefer standard Salesforce features or declarative tools where they make sense, and suggest the appropriate technology
* Be consistent with already existing code
* Suggest Seed Data Updates — if a data model is modified and seed data exists in `/data`, suggest whether the test records should be updated.
* Use the same API version which is in `sfdx-project.json`
* Write all code in English, but use Custom Labels for user-facing text

### Don't
- **Don't commit directly to `main` or `master` branch.** All changes go through PRs.
- **Never deploy to production.** Releases are always made and approved by the release manager.
- **Update or delete any data in production.**
